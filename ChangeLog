	* libports/ports.h (port_info) [__cplusplus]: Rename `class' field to
	`port_class'.
	(ports_create_port, ports_create_port_noinstall, ports_import_port,
	ports_lookup_port, ports_lookup_payload, ports_count_class,
	ports_enable_class, ports_class_iterate, _ports_bucket_class_iterate,

	* ext2fs/dir.c (diskfs_direnter_hard): On missing room to extend
	directory, return ENOSPC.

	ext2fs: Do not talk about crashing on ENOSPC
	* ext2fs/pager.c (pager_unlock_page): Do not say that ext2fs will crash
	because of ENOSPC.

2016-11-20  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	libpager, libstore: Fix crash on ENOSPC while writing data
	We need to save blocked signals, otherwise longjmp will not unblock
	SIGSEGV/SIGBUS, and thus next exception will kill us. Also, we need to
	make sure that the preemptor is set at the right window in main memory
	before letting a handler see it.

	* libpager/pager-memcpy.c (do_memcpy): Call __sync_synchronize()
	between aligning the fault preemptor and actually accessing data.

2016-11-14  Brent W. Baccala  <cosine@freesoft.org>

	libpager: fix returning error on data_unlock
	The _pager_lock_object call needs to be asynchronous because libpager is
	single threaded, at least in the sense that individual memory objects
	only process one request at a time.  In this case, we're processing a
	data_unlock request, and would have to handle a lock_completed message
	before lock_object would return (synchronously).

	* libpager/data-unlock.c (_pager_S_memory_object_data_unlock): Pass 0 to
	sync parameter of _pager_lock_object() call.

2016-11-06  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

2016-11-05  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	instead.

	* boot/boot.c (options): Improve documentation.
	(struct dev_map): Rename fields, document, store the name of the
	device file instead of a port.
	(add_dev_map): Update accordingly.
	(lookup_dev): Likewise.
	(ds_device_open): Open the device file here instead.

2016-11-05  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	eth-multiplexer: Generate stable ethernet addresses.
	Previously, the ethernet multiplexer generated ethernet addresses for
	the virtual interfaces using a pseudo-random number generator.  This
	has the downside of generating a new address every time.  Generate
	stable pseudo-random addresses instead.

	* eth-multiplexer/Makefile (HURDLIBS): Link to libihash.
	* eth-multiplexer/ethernet.c (ether_address): New variable.

2016-11-05  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	eth-multiplexer: Fix retrieving status of virtual interfaces.
	Previously, the ethernet multiplexer returned the status of the real
	network device if one was configured.  This had the unfortunate
	consequence that all virtual devices shared the same ethernet address.

	* eth-multiplexer/device_impl.c (ds_device_get_status): Always return
	the information for the virtual device.
	* eth-multiplexer/vdev.h (dev_getstat): Add prototype.

2016-11-05  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	eth-multiplexer: Fix packet delivery.
	* eth-multiplexer/vdev.c (deliver_msg): Do not return an error if
	delivering a message fails.  Doing so prevents all other filters from
	being executed, and more importantly aborts the iteration over all
	virtual devices.

2016-11-01  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	boot: Allow unprivileged users to boot Subhurds.
	Previously, boot handed privileged kernel ports to Subhurds.  This

	standard RNG can trivially predict the next 20 bytes of output.

	The bug was found and reported by Felix Dörre and Vladimir Klebanov,
	Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  A paper describing the problem in
	detail will shortly be published.

	This is a port of c6dbfe89 from the GnuPG classic branch.

	or called with a small array.

	This notably happens when using a sub-exec, see BZ #48919.

	* exec/hashexec.c (check_hashbang): Check std_nports before accessing
	std_ports.

2016-08-28  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	typo

	remap: Refuse non-absolute paths
	* trans/remap.c (parse_opt): Error out if some path is not absolute.

2016-08-26  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Fix loading small pic programs
	It happens that the link script for ld.so contains a hole, which might thus
	leave an empty page between the text and the data.  When loading a small pic
	program, its text would then fit in there, and loading the data right after
	it would fail.  We here rather force all pic loads to be mapped
	contiguously, starting from the place that was allocated for the first pic
	load.

	* exec/exec.c (load_section): Return the address of the end of the section.
	(load): Take the address to be used for loading pic objects as parameter,
	force pic objects there if it is not zero, and compute and return the
	address to be used for the next pic object.
	(do_exec): Pass addresses for pic loads between calls to load().

2016-08-23  Kalle Olavi Niemitalo  <kon@iki.fi>

	rpctrace: Print beyond '\0' in MACH_MSG_TYPE_CHAR.
	This will now display the 'argv: data_t' argument of file_exec
	as e.g. "who\0am\0i\0" rather than just "who".  In contrast,
	the 'file_name: string_t' argument of dir_lookup will still be
	truncated at the first null character.

	The previous implementation might crash if an out-of-line
	char array exactly fills a page and does not contain any
	null characters.

	* utils/rpctrace.c (print_data): On MACH_MSG_TYPE_STRING and
	MACH_MSG_TYPE_CHAR, check for end of buffer before checking for a null
	character.  On MACH_MSG_TYPE_CHAR only, continue printing past null
	characters.

2016-08-20  Brent W. Baccala  <cosine@freesoft.org>

	mach-defpager: Add missing unlock
	* mach-defpager/default_pager.c (destroy_paging_partition): Add missing
	unlock when destroying partition fails.

	mach-defpager: Fix debugging prints formats

	pager_write_offset, default_read, default_write, destroy_paging_partition,
	seqnos_memory_object_terminate, seqnos_memory_object_data_request,
	seqnos_memory_object_data_initialize): Fix debugging prints formats.

2016-08-16  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Drop OTILDE support

	has been written elsewhere.
	* trans/crash.c (corefile_template): New variable.

2016-08-07  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	libpager: provide 'pager_create_alloc'
	Add a variant to 'pager_create' that allocates memory for the user
	hook next to the pager data increasing locality.

	* console/pager.c (pager_clear_user_data): Fix type of 'idx', do not
	free 'upi'.
	(user_pager_create): Use the new function.
	* doc/hurd.texi: Document new function.
	* ext2fs/pager.c (pager_clear_user_data): Don't free 'upi'.

	Do not make io_select return errors on unsupported READ/WRITE mode
	The descriptor is valid, it is just the mode which is not available.

	* console-client/kbd-repeat.c (repeater_select): Drop SELECT_URG flag from

2016-06-04  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	trans/crash: fix resource leaks
	Previously, 'task', 'core_file', and 'ctty_id' were not deallocated if
	crash was configured to write core files, and 'ctty_id' was leaked if
	the crashing task was suspended.  This lead to resources not being
	released in the kernel, the filesystem, and the terminal subsystem,
	and could very well be responsible for making the Debian/Hurd shutdown
	hang.

	* trans/crash.c (S_crash_dump_task): Properly deallocate 'task',
	'core_file', and 'ctty_id'.

2016-06-03  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	nfs: appease the stricter reference counting mechanism
	* nfs/cache.c (netfs_node_norefs): Do not re-acquire a reference to
	np.  This worked previously, but the new reference counting primitives
	consider this a use after free.  A reference is really not necessary
	here, we are about to deallocate np anyway.

	Amends 5eef605e.

	This reverts commit 8c49801c8f7e3f800cabedf8fca8ccec3cf35a22.

	The malloc hook is needed for calloc.

2016-05-23  Thomas Schwinge  <thomas@codesourcery.com>

	Revert part of "fix compiler warnings in hurd/exec"
	This reverts part of commit 05c3ffac543052c8d0b171a5f77bb977d5316a61.  These
	type casts are no longer needed after the commit
	e914bfc3d6e5ddf6f8c5e93a4334873a48a24ddf changes.

	* exec/elfcore.c: Revert type casts added in commit
	05c3ffac543052c8d0b171a5f77bb977d5316a61.

	ext2fs: fix pager use-after-free
	Previously, pagers had no reference for being part of a node, only for
	having a send right made for them.  Hence we sometimes saw
	use-after-free errors if the kernel did give up that send right,
	typically while deleting files.  Keep a weak reference as long as the
	pager is referenced by a node.

	* ext2fs/pager.c (pager_clear_user_data): Assert that 'pager' has been
	NULLed.
	(pager_dropweak): Drop the weak reference and NULL 'pager'.

	Avoid superfluous locking of node
	* libdiskfs/io-restrict-auth.c (diskfs_S_io_restrict_auth): Do not

	* libnetfs/io-restrict-auth.c (netfs_S_io_restrict_auth): Likewise.

	utils/settrans: implement active translator stacking
	* utils/settrans.c (OPT_STACK): New macro.

	libnetfs: treat disconnected shadow roots as virtual roots
	* libnetfs/dir-lookup.c (netfs_S_dir_lookup): Treat a shadow_root with

	(netfs_S_dir_lookup): Use the function from libfshelp instead.
	* libnetfs/fsys-getroot.c (netfs_S_fsys_getroot): Adapt accordingly.
	* libnetfs/trans-callback.c (_netfs_translator_callback2_fn): Likewise.

	libdiskfs: cosmetic changes
	* libdiskfs/dir-lookup.c (diskfs_S_dir_lookup): Rename identifiers to
	be more idiomatic and closer to libnetfs and the interface
	specification.  Massage the code so that it aligns closer with the
	dir_lookup server function in libnetfs.  It should not change the
	behavior.

	libnetfs: rename 'diruser' to 'dircred'
	* libnetfs/dir-lookup.c (netfs_S_dir_lookup): Rename 'diruser' to

	copy.

2016-05-03  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Fix build
	* trans/crash.c: Include <assert.h>.

2016-04-29  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	libihash: rehash if effective load exceeds the threshold
	Previously, if a hash table was not growing anymore but entries were
	regularly replaced, the tombstones would accumulate slowing down
	lookups and insertions.  A possible solution is to rehash the table if
	the effective load exceeds the configured threshold.  The effective
	load also takes tombstones into account.

	* libihash/ihash.c (hurd_ihash_locp_add): Use the effective load.
	(hurd_ihash_add): Likewise.  Use the load to decide whether we want to
	enlarge the table, otherwise we merely rehash.

2016-04-29  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	libihash: keep track of free slots
	* libihash/ihash.c (hurd_ihash_init): Init new field 'nr_free'.

	(hurd_ihash_add): Reset counter on reallocation.
	* libihash/ihash.h (struct hurd_ihash): New field 'nr_free'.
	(hurd_ihash_get_effective_load): New function.

2016-04-29  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	libihash: fix index computation
	Previously, find_index would return a suboptimal slot if a tombstone
	was in the optimal slot.

	* libihash/ihash.c (find_index): Fix index computation.

2016-04-29  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Fix root operations on trivfs-translated nodes
	* libtrivfs/fsys-getroot.c: When `uids` contain 0, make a verbatim copy of

2016-04-28  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	startup: write all messages to stderr
	This avoids the need to flush the buffer and works around a weird
	problem with 'puts' not printing a newline.

	* startup/startup.c: Write all messages to stderr.

2016-04-28  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	startup: use the generated default server implementations
	* startup/Makefile: Set appropriate flags.
	* startup/startup.c: Drop most stub functions.

	startup: add verbose parameter
	* startup/startup.c: Add verbose parameter and inform about progress
	through the bootstrap procedure if it is given.

	startup: implement bits of the fs and io protocols
	* startup/Makefile: Build fs and io server with default
	implementations.
	(mung_msg_S.h): Tune regexp only to match the include guard.
	* startup/startup.c (mig_reply_setup): New function.
	(demuxer): Add new protocols.  Nicer implementation.
	(S_file_check_access): New function.
	(S_io_restrict_auth): Likewise.

	Unify and document the way fsids are handled in trivfs translators
	* doc/hurd.texi: Clarify what happens if 'trivfs_fsid' is zero.

	libdiskfs: Reject LFS seeks and read/writes
	vm_offset_t (used by pager_memcpy) is not 64bit-ready yet. Reject requests
	which go further than this.

	* libdiskfs/io-seek.c (diskfs_S_io_seek): Return EFBIG when requested offset
	is beyond limits of vm_offset_t.
	* libdiskfs/rdwr-internal.c (_diskfs_rdwr_internal): Return EFBIG when

2016-04-26  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Fix supporting >4GiB files in ext2fs
	* ext2fs/inode.c (diskfs_user_read_node): When sizeof(off_t) >= 8, add
	di->i_size_high as high-64bit part to st->st_size. Drop setting
	unused info->i_high_size.
	(write_node): When sizeof(off_t) >= 8, write high-64bit part of st->st_size
	to di->i_size_high.
	* ext2fs/ext2_fs_i.h (ext2_inode_info): Remove i_high_size field.
	* pfinet/linux-src/include/linux/ext2_fs_i.h (ext2_inode_info): Likewise.

2016-04-26  Justus Winter  <justus@gnupg.org>

	libtrivfs: fix notion of privileged user
	Set 'is_root' if the node has been opened by the root user (this was
	the old behavior) or if it has been opened by the user the translator
	is executing under.

	This fixes the irritating bug that an unprivileged user cannot control
	her own trivfs-based translators.  It does not change how privileged
	trivfs translators work.

	* libtrivfs/io-reauthenticate.c (trivfs_S_io_reauthenticate): Use the
	new function to compute 'isroot'.
	* libtrivfs/io-restrict-auth.c (trivfs_S_io_restrict_auth): Likewise.

	Agreed. I think only devnode should include it in mig-mutate.h. For

	Fix race condition in ext2fs when remounting
	On some systems, ext2fs.static would regularly hang at startup, as a
	race condition meant it would process paging requests while remounting.
	To fix this, libpager has been altered to allow inhibiting and resuming
	its worker threads, and ext2fs uses this to inhibit paging while
	remounting.

	* console/pager.c (pager_requests): New variable.

	* trans/fakeroot.c (netfs_report_access): When FAKE_MODE is not set on
	`np', call file_check_access on the underlying node instead of returning
	O_RDWR|O_EXEC.

2015-08-14  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Make fakeroot return file types from underly fs
	Fakeroot does not support faking them anyway, and they may change on the

2015-08-14  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	libports: clarify why we emulate protected payloads
	The Hurd uses protected payloads to improve the receiver lookup on the
	server side to the point that we no longer do a hash table lookup in
	the dispatch code.

	If the kernel does not support protected payloads, we degrade
	gracefully, do one lookup in libports' dispatching code, and emulate
	the protected payload feature to still save one hash table lookup in
	the intrans function.

	* libports/manage-multithread.c (ports_manage_port_operations_multithread):
	Add comment.
	* libports/manage-one-thread.c (ports_manage_port_operations_one_thread):

	exec: fix setting the name of early servers
	Previously, the exec server did not set the name of the servers
	started before the proc server.  Instead this was done by the startup
	server, but this was merely a workaround, missing notably the startup
	server itself.

	* exec/exec.c (set_name): New function.
	(do_exec): Move the code setting the name to a new function, and also
	call it if the proc server is not started yet.

	console-client: Fix lower range of binary search
	To prevent infinite recursion range checking was introduced
	as an exit condition adding two extra comparisons on each
	recursive call.

	By fixing the range used by the recursive call over the lower
	half of the array one can avoid penalizing successful lookups
	while still preventing infinite recursion due to `first`
	parameter being greater than `last` parameter.

	* console-client/xkb/kstoucs.c (find_ucs): don't remove middle from the
	lower range. Remove extra comparisons.

2015-06-05  Diego Nieto Cid  <dnietoc@gmail.com>

2015-05-23  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	console-client: fix binary search
	Previously, the binary search through the keysym map was incorrectly

	libdiskfs: implement a node cache
	Previously, all users of libdiskfs implemented a node cache on their

	Revert "random: fix a receiver lookup"
	This reverts "8927fbd63e29005ddb9b2c2264046089bf669857".

	The change mistakenly adds mutators for the `startup' protocol, but
	the server routine is for the `startup_notify' protocol.

	* libfshelp/lock-acquire.c (__LOCK_ATOMIC): New macro
	(fshelp_acquire_lock): When __LOCK_ATOMIC is set, do not release the
	lock early, change the lock hold atomically instead. On upgrade to LOCK_EX,
	prevent new shared locks from being acquired to avoid starvation.

	libpager: make the request queue more memory-efficient
	Previously, `pager_demuxer' allocated a chunk of memory for the
	response message.  But if memory gets scarce, the kernel will issue a
	large number of paging requests to free up memory.  In such a
	situation, allocating memory is dangerous.

	Fix this by not allocating space for the response message, rather, use
	a chunk of the workers stack space.  Also, we only handle the `notify'
	and `memory_object' protocol, which both only contain simple routines,
	we only need a `mig_response_header_t'.

	* libpager/demuxer.c (struct request): Remove `inp' and `outp'.
	(request_inp): New function.
	(pager_demuxer): Do not allocate memory for the response.
	(mig_reply_setup): New function.
	(worker_func): Adjust accordingly.

	(boot_script_read_file): Remove unused function.

2014-11-21  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	startup: bind the startup server to /servers/startup
	Previously, the Hurd (ab)used the fact that the startup server speaks
	all protocols on its message port.  Any server that wished to register
	for shutdown notifications would use proc_getmsgport to get a port to
	the startup server.

	This hardcodes the PID of /hurd/startup, and does not allow one to
	point a server to ones own startup server (e.g. using remap).

	Bind the startup server to /servers/startup instead.  Use this to
	contact the startup server.

	* exec/main.c (S_exec_init): Use /servers/startup.  Fall back to the
	old method so that the system still boots when the node
	/servers/startup is missing.
	* hurd/paths.h (_SERVERS_STARTUP): New macro.
	* libdiskfs/boot-start.c (diskfs_S_fsys_init): Use /servers/startup.

2014-11-21  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	startup: do not pass signals on to the child
	Formerly /hurd/startup would forward all signals to the child it
	started (e.g. /libexec/runsystem).

	The motivation for doing so is not revealed in the comments, nor it is
	mentioned in the history of the version control system.

	This patch removes the forwarding of signals to the child.

	* startup/startup.c (process_signal): Do not pass signals on to the child.
	* startup/stubs.c: Remove file.
	* startup/Makefile: Remove stubs.c.

2014-11-21  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	init: add a minimalist init program
	This patch adds a minimalist init program.  It is somewhat lacking in
	features, but is able to bring up a Hurd system with the runsystem and
	rc scripts.  In fact, it roughly does what the former /hurd/init did,
	modulo all the very early bootstrapping stuff and the startup
	protocol.  It is started when all the essential servers are up and
	running, so it can make use of most of the POSIX goodies, making its
	implementation much simpler.

	* Makefile (prog-subdirs): Add init.
	* daemons/runsystem.sh: Generalize runsystem so that it can start any
	init as specified on the kernel command line.  By default, it starts
	/hurd/init.
	* daemons/runsystem.hurd: This is a verbatim copy of runsystem.sh.  It
	is started by /hurd/init.
	* daemons/rc.sh: Do not start /hurd/mach-defpager as it is already
	started in runsystem.sh.
	* daemons/Makefile (SRCS): Add runsystem.hurd.
	* init/Makefile: New file.
	* init/init.c: Likewise.

2014-11-21  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	startup: rename /hurd/init to /hurd/startup
	This patch series splits /hurd/init into two programs.  As a first

	(create_startup_proc): Rename to create_init_proc.
	* proc/main.c (main): Create placeholder proc object for pid 1.

	(S_proc_set_init_task): New function.
	* doc/hurd.texi (Server Bootstrap): Update accordingly.

	* trans/mtab.c (struct mtab): Add a hash table to keep track of seen
	ports.
	(mtab_mark_as_seen): New function that records the identity port of a
	given node in the hash table and reports whether it has been there
	before.
	(mtab_populate): Use the new function to avoid running in circles.
	(main, open_hook): Initialize hash table.

2014-11-03  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	libpager: use a fixed number of threads
	Previously, libpager used an unbounded number of threads to receive
	messages from the pager bucket.  It used sequence barriers to execute
	the requests to order requests to each object.

	The sequence barriers are implemented in seqnos.c.  A server function
	uses _pager_wait_for_seqno to wait for its sequence number and
	_pager_release_seqno to release it, or it uses _pager_update_seqno to
	do both operations in one step.

	These sequence barriers divide each server function in three parts: A,
	B, and C.  A_i happens "before" the sequence barrier i, B_i happens
	"in order", C_i happens "after" the sequence barrier.  This partial
	order < has the following properties:

	* This order is *per object*.  Requests to different objects are not
	  ordered.

	* A_i < B_i,  B_i < C_i (due to the structure of the code)

	* B_i < B_{i+1} (this is due to the sequence barriers)

	* Note that only the B parts are ordered by the sequence numbers, we
	  are free to execute C_i and C_{i+1} in any possible order.  The same
	  argument applies to the A parts.

	The sequence barriers are implemented using a very simple ticket
	algorithm.  Every request, even the invalid ones, is processed by a
	thread, and waits until the ticket count reaches its seqno, does some
	work in-order, then increments the ticket and awakes all threads that
	have piled up up to this moment.  All of them except one will then
	discover that it's not their turn yet and go to sleep again.

	Creating one thread per request has proven to be problematic as
	memory_object requests often arrive in large batches.

	This patch does two things:

	* Use a single thread to receive messages from the port bucket.  All
	  incoming request are put into a queue.

	* Use a fixed-number of threads (though even one is actually enough)
	  to execute the the server functions.  If multiple threads are used,
	  a work-delegation mechanism ensures that the per object order < is
	  preserved.

	For reference, I used the following command to create workloads that
	highlight the problem this patch is addressing:

	% settrans t .../ext2fs --sync=30 /dev/sd2s1
	...
	% /usr/bin/time zsh -c 'for ((i=0; i < 1500; i++)); do

	libports: use a global hash table for the lookups
	Previously, libports used a hash table per port bucket.  This makes
	looking up a port difficult if one does not know the port bucket, as
	one has to iterate over all buckets and do a hash table lookup each.

	Having to iterate over the buckets makes it necessary to keep a list
	of all buckets, which has to be updated and protected by a lock as
	well.

	Also, the current code in _ports_bucket_class_iterate iterates over
	the hash table associated with the bucket given.  When
	ports_class_iterate calls this common function, it obtains a reference
	to the bucket from one of the ports in the given class.  This will not
	work if a class contains ports in different port buckets.  This
	limitation is not documented as far as I can see.  Again, having to
	maintain this list has its cost and requires serialization.

	Use a global hash table for lookups instead.  Keep the per-bucket hash
	tables for efficient iteration over buckets.  Furthermore, serialize
	access to all hash tables using a separate lock.  Remove the linked
	lists of all buckets and all ports in a class.

	* libports/bucket-iterate.c (ports_bucket_iterate): Acquire

	hurd: fix semantic of file_get_children
	When first introduced as fsys_get_children, it made sense to return
	the list of children using paths relative to the root of the
	filesystem that was queried.  Making the get_children method part of
	the fsys protocol was a mistake that has since been corrected in
	9366d6b2.

	Instead of returning paths relative to the root of the translator,
	return paths relative to the path of the receiving node.

	This fixes a problem with the mtab translator.  Previously, the mtab
	translator invoked on a target that was not the root directory of a
	translator would compute invalid paths, e.g.:

	/hurd/mtab: /any/path/servers/socket/26 No such file or directory

	libdiskfs: use a hash table for the name cache
	Previously, name cache lookup operation completed in O(n) time.  This
	means that making the cache too large would decrease the performance.
	Therefore it was required to tune the size.

	Implement the name cache using a hash table.

	We use buckets of a fixed size.  We approximate the least-frequently
	used cache algorithm by counting the number of lookups using
	saturating arithmetic in the two lowest bits of the pointer to the
	name.  Using this strategy we achieve a constant worst-case lookup and
	insertion time.

	Since we are not bound by the size of the cache anymore, increase its
	size from 200 to 1024.

	libnetfs: add netfs_make_node_alloc to allocate fat nodes
	libnetfs has two kind of nodes, struct node and struct netnode.
	struct node is used to store libnetfs specific data, while struct

	libihash: do not use an integer hash function by default
	Recently libihash was changed to use an integer hash function on the
	keys in an attempt to reduce the rate of collisions (2d898893), which
	has long been assumed to be high.

	Richard Braun was kind enough to run some benchmarks.  He observed:

	"1/ Using an extremely simple microbenchmark [1] that merely inserts
	keys, either random integers or sequential ones to match the way port
	names are managed, it seems that the previous code, despite its
	apparent flaws, did quite well.

	[1] http://darnassus.sceen.net/gitweb/rbraun/ihtest.git

	Using an integer hashing function actually reduces performance on the
	sequential integer test case. It makes sense because, considering a
	set of consecutive integers starting from 0, and a hash table that
	always has more slots than items, a modulo is a perfect hash
	function. Even when taking into account that only names for receive
	rights are normally managed with libihash, i.e. that keys aren't
	actually sequential, they are almost all equally distributed, leading
	to very few collisions.

	Therefore, as a third option, I've removed the hashing function,
	leaving only a fast modulo (an AND) and this variant provided the best
	raw results.

	2/ I've also built hurd packages multiple times and got average build
	times with each variant (previous, new, new without hash function) and
	here are the results I obtained respectively : 52m59s, 52m31s, 52m22s."

	Do not use the integer hash function on the keys by default.

	* libihash/ihash.c (murmur3_mix32): Remove now unused function.
	(find_index): Use the fast division method to derive the index.
	(add_one): Likewise.  Also, update the comment to reflect the current

	libihash: use fast binary scaling to determine the load
	Expressing the maximum load in binary percent (where 128b% corresponds
	to 100%) allows us to use fast binary scaling to determine if the
	maximum load has been reached without losing precision.

	Furthermore, the previously used expression 'ht->nr_items * 100'

	libihash: use linear probing and fast modulo operation
	libihash uses open addressing.  Previously, quadratic probing in both

	result in a less efficient use of caches.

	Also, prime numbers of the form 4 * i + 3 were used as array sizes.
	This was used in combination with the integer modulo operation for
	hashing.  It has been known for some time that libihash suffers from
	collisions, so a integer hash function is now applied to the keys to
	derive the index.

	Use linear probing instead.  Also, use powers of two for the array
	sizes, so a bit mask can be used for the modulo operation.

	The performance of hash tables depend critically on a low number of

	80%.  This seems a bit optimistic (e. g. java.util.Hashtable uses 75%

	libports: reduce malloc overhead in _ports_bucket_class_iterate
	_ports_bucket_class_iterate creates a snapshot of the buckets hash
	table.  This is done so that the lock protecting the hash table can be
	released while we iterate over the snapshot.

	Formerly, a linked list was used to store the snapshot.  As the
	maximal number of items is known, using an array is much simpler.

	_ports_bucket_class_iterate implements both ports_bucket_iterate and
	ports_class_iterate.  For this change might make ports_class_iterate
	less efficient memory-wise if the number of ports belonging to the
	class is low with respect to the number of ports in the bucket.  If
	this happens, we allocate too much.  Alleviate this by releasing
	unused memory.

	On the other hand, the array representation is more compact.
	Furthermore a survey of the Hurd code revealed that
	ports_class_iterate is rarely used, while ports_bucket_iterate is used
	more often, most prominently in paging code.

	ext2fs: fix type of inum
	Previously, inum was of type int, whereas dino_ref expects ino_t.  On
	Hurd/x86 the former is 32 bit wide, the latter 64.  If dino_ref is
	inlined, this does not seem to pose a problem, but if ext2fs is
	compiled with -O0, this most likely results in an invalid memory access.

	* ext2fs/ialloc.c (ext2_alloc_inode): Use type ino_t for inum.

	libports: work around bugs in server termination
	Some servers use ports_manage_port_operations_one_thread to process
	requests and terminate when it returns. Since many of them don't detach
	before shutting down, a client may receive an error if its request
	arrived while the server is shutting down. Prevent those spurious errors
	by forcing ports_manage_port_operations_one_thread not to return.

	This is the same change as 235491231bdd1fd93507c835767503f047e10b91
	introduced for ports_manage_port_operations_multithread.

	* libports/manage-one-thread.c

	libdiskfs: set the default sync interval to 30 seconds
	The default sync interval has been changed in 9e55fdd7 from 30 to 5

	At least for current hardware, using 30 seconds instead of just 5
	alleviates the thread-storm problem.  Make 30 seconds the default
	again.

	mach-defpager: replace the magic typecast with a hash table
	Previously, the mach-defpager used a "magic typecast" for object

	and upon receiving a message it would cast the port name back to a
	pointer.

	While this might seem like an optimization, it actually makes the port
	handling in the kernel less efficient.  Ports with small continuous
	names are stored in an array, while other ports get spilled in a splay
	tree.

	Replace the linked list of default_port_t objects with a hash table.
	Do not rename the ports, rather use the hash table to lookup objects
	associated with ports.

	trans/fakeroot: fix cached node retrieval on lookup
	When a client finds a node from the hash table, it could happen that

	trans/fakeroot: rework node caching
	Instead of the FAKE_REFERENCE flag, rework node caching so that nodes are
	retained only if their attributes are actually changed. In addition, don't
	remove unreferenced nodes from the hash table at protid release, since
	their reference counter is unstable. Do it on node destruction, once the
	reference counter has reached 0. This means lookups can return nodes not
	referenced (other than by the hash table), a condition for which a check
	is added. By never acquiring a reference on such nodes, their counter is
	guaranteed to remain stable once unreferenced.

	libfshelp: fix the api of fshelp_set_active_translator
	To detect if an active translator goes away, we need to register for
	dead name notifications. Those notifications have to be sent to a port
	known to the ports library, as the ports library handles the dead name
	notifications. The most straight forward way is to use the port to the

	Traditionally, /proc/mounts includes only filesystem mount points.
	Previously though, the mtab translator included any kind of

	trans/mtab: remove the loop detection logic
	Previously the mtab detector tried to detect whether it talks to
	itself by comparing the control port of the translator it currently
	visits with its own. This was done to prevent deadlocks. However, this
	did not detect non-trivial loops, i.e. two mtab translators would
	still dead-lock each other.

	Now that it is safe to actually file_name_lookup the root node of a

	<hangs>

	Fix this by exiting if the last client of fakeroot goes away.

	If noone has a right to any control or protid port, noone can ever
	reacquire any such right. So it is safe to shutdown the fakeroot

	utils/settrans: fix the teardown of chrooted environments
	Previously, settrans --chroot would just exec the target.  Create a
	new process for that purpose.  Wait for its completion, then ask the
	translator (nicely by default) to go away.  If it refuses with EBUSY,
	it might be because some process has daemonized inside the chrooted
	environment.

	This fixes the following bug when settrans is used with fakeroot:

	% fakeroot-hurd /bin/true 2>&1 | tee
	<hangs>

	Here, fakeroot-hurd execs settrans with --chroot, settrans execs
	/hurd/fakeauth which will eventually exec the target /bin/true.  When
	true terminates, it will close its stdout and stderr.  But
	/hurd/fakeroot's stderr is also connected to tee's stdin, preventing

	The function new_node creates virtual nodes using netfs_make_node.
	Nodes created with netfs_make_node already have a reference count of

	trans: fix reference counting and destruction of fake nodes
	Previously, fakeroot tried to do too much in netfs_node_norefs.  This
	function is meant to deallocate nodes.  Fakeroot however also tries to
	remove the node from the hash table and to prolong the lifetime of the
	node object by re-referencing it.

	Removing the object from the hash table is highly problematic, because
	at this point we already have the node locked.  With proper locking in
	netfs_S_dir_lookup, acquiring the hash table lock while we hold the
	node locked results in dead-locks, releasing the node lock before
	acquiring the hash table lock results in a race condition.

	Prolonging the lifetime of the node by re-acquiring a reference is
	clearly a hack that surprisingly works to some degree.  The nodes
	transbox, however, is already gone at this point.

	This code was never actually run because of a reference-counting bug
	in fakeroot.

	Fix this by installing our own clean routine in the
	netfs_protid_class.  This function is called without the associated
	node being locked, allowing us to acquire the locks in the proper
	order and to keep the hash table locked while the node is being
	destroyed.

	* trans/fakeroot.c (netfs_node_norefs): Just free the associated
	resources.
	(fakeroot_netfs_release_protid): New function doing cleanly what
	netfs_node_norefs did before.

	trans: make the fakeroot environment more transparent
	Previously fakeroot did not explicitly proxy io_identity requests, so

	getcwd logic (assuming /media/scratch is a translator):

	% cd /media/scratch/foo && fakeroot-hurd pwd
	/foo

	Fix this by proxying io_identity requests. Since then no-one is
	handing out our netfs_fsys_identity port anymore, an optimization in

	When looking up files, fakeroot intercepts reauthentication requests

	incorrectly assume that the lookup is finished (assuming
	/media/scratch is a translator):

	% cd /media/scratch && fakeroot-hurd pwd
	pwd: reading directory `..': Bad file descriptor

	Make the reauthentication completely transparent to the client by

	/bin/sh: 1: cannot create /tmp/some_file: Is a directory

	Fix this by sanitizing the flags value not to contain O_WRITE if we're

	pfinet: fix emission on the loopback device
	Unlike other devices, sending packets on the loopback device causes the

	pflocal: fix port leak when receiving port rights
	The socket_send and socket_recv routines can be used to transmit port
	rights along data. Unfortunately, pflocal retains a copy of these rights
	in the socket_recv RPC. These lingering references would in turn lead to
	other leaks in servers waiting for a no-sender notification to clean
	their resources. Since these copied rights aren't used at all by the
	server, it is safe to simply move them to the recipient instead.

	* pflocal/socket.c (S_socket_recv): Transmit port rights using
	MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND transfer type instead of MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND.

2013-10-18  Richard Braun  <rbraun@sceen.net>

	libdiskfs: fix removal of socket nodes
	When the file system supports ifsock shortcuts, a socket node can obtain
	a right on a socket address. This reference is only lost if the address
	is destroyed, through a dead-name notification. On the other hand,
	pflocal keeps the address around until all references are dropped. This
	leads to a situation where socket nodes, addresses, and their associated
	sockets are leaked. To remedy the situation, make addresses get a light
	reference on socket nodes, and properly deallocate it when the node is
	destroyed, which will in turn make pflocal correctly remove the matching
	address and socket.

	* libdiskfs/ifsock.c (diskfs_S_ifsock_getsockaddr): Add a light reference
	instead of a hard one.
	* libdiskfs/node-nput.c (diskfs_nput): Deallocate right to socket address
	when cleaning light references.

2013-10-18  Richard Braun  <rbraun@sceen.net>

	pflocal: fix destruction of explicitely bound sockets
	Sockets must have a weak reference on the address they're bound to so
	that addr_unbind is properly called before addr_clean. For sockets that
	are automatically bound, this weak reference is created in ensure_addr.
	Do the same in sock_bind.

	* pflocal/sock.c (sock_bind): Handle weak reference on addr.

	Revert "tmpfs: drop privileges in the tmpfs translator"
	This reverts commit 7075bc11289355478659cd1610632a9299734afc.

	Dropping the unix privileges of the tmpfs translator causes problems
	with the passive translator startup. The function fshelp_fetch_root
	creates an auth handle containing the processes original UID and
	GID. But if the privileges were dropped before, this operation fails
	with EPERM.

	This commit also broke mkfifo(3), possibly for similar or related
	reasons.

	* tmpfs/tmpfs.c (main): Do not drop all privileges.

	exec: remove support for transparently ungziping executables
	Remove support for transparently ungziping executables from the exec
	server. The code in question makes the exec server unnecessarily
	complex and since the exec server is an essential process, crashing it
	makes /hurd/init crash the whole system.

	Since the gzip code is not thread-safe, all access to it is
	serialized, so there is a trivial way for one user to delay another
	users gzipped executables for some unspecified time.

	This can be accomplished by padding any program with easily compressed
	data, zipping it and executing it. Using such a program as an passive
	translator and then triggering its execution by the filesystem
	translator also stalls any requests to that filesystem (observed using
	the libdiskfs-based ext2fs).

	Since compressed executables cannot be mapped into the memory, they
	have to be uncompressed into allocated memory first. This is slower
	and any user with access to the exec server can make it allocate
	arbitrary amounts of memory. If the Hurd had proper memory accounting,
	this would probably be a way around it.

	So the compression support in exec seemingly creates various issues
	for little value, at least with the abundance of nonvolatile memory
	available today.

	* exec/Makefile: Remove gzip related files.
	* exec/exec.c: Remove anything #ifdef GZIPped.

	init: Mark all of inits children and init itself as important
	This is based on a fragment of Guillem Jovers patch presented here:

	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2006-02/msg00081.html

	It has been refreshed, updated and the copyright year is adjusted
	properly. It has been complemented with the necessary features to
	address the issues the original patch set out to address, namely
	that killall5 freezes the proc translator before it tries to walk
	over /proc/*/stat to decide which process to kill. Prior to this
	patch (and the one marking the procfs server as important
	process), killall5 would deadlock trying to walk over the proc
	file system.

	Ironically it would not have killed any process later on even if
	it had the chance, since two values obtained from /proc/*/stat
	are currently hardcoded to zero in our procfs. Patches addressing
	the problem as a whole are prepared and will be sent as a follow
	up.

	exec: remove the BFD code
	This commit removes the parts of the exec server that were once using
	the Binary File Descriptor library.

	As I understand it, the BFD code stopped working because it uses stdio
	streams and the glue code for that has never been ported to libio. The
	code has been #ifdefed out ever since. It may or may not work in its
	current state, so it is removed. If someone is interested, it can
	always be recovered from the version control system.

	* exec/exec.c: Remove all BFD related code.
	* exec/priv.h: Likewise.
	* TODO: Remove the corresponding item.

2013-08-28  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	exec: Remove #ifdef 0-out code for user specified exec servers.
	This code was meant to allow the user to specify alternative exec
	servers using an environment variable. The Hurd uses the file system
	as namespace for server lookups, so the proper way to use one's own
	exec server seems to be the remap translator.

	sutils: fix the semantic of -t, --types in fstab.c
	The mount utility on both Linux and FreeBSD allows one to either
	specify a whitelist or a blacklist of filesystem types to consider for
	--all. Prefixing the list with "no" indicates that the list is a
	blacklist. Furthermore, Linux' mount utility ignores a "no" prefix on
	any entry in the given list.

	Previously the Hurd variant first applied whitelist containing all
	positive values given and then filtered the resulting list using all
	negative values. But this makes little sense because each entry only
	has one value for the filesystem type (mnt_type) and all values are
	mutually exclusive.

	This patch adjusts the fstab handling code so that our mount utility
	behaves like the Linux mount utility. This code is used by both mount
	and fsck. The same argumentation applies to fsck as well.

	Like implemented in Linux mount, any "no" prefix is ignored to retain
	compatibility with the old behavior.

	* sutils/fstab.c (fstab_argp_create): Fix semantic of --types.

2013-08-28  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	sutils: allow multiple entries for the device "none"
	Previously it was not possible to add two mount entries with the same
	device information to an fstab structure. This is easily fixed by
	breaking the assumption, that there is only one possible mount entry
	for the "none" device as used by many purely virtual file systems.

	* utils/fstab.c (fstab_find_device): Return NULL if name is "none".

2013-08-28  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	mount: ignore mounted filesystems if --all is given

2013-08-28  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	mount: implement -O, --test-opts
	--test-opts in combination with --all mounts only those filesystems
	with options matching the given set of options.

	Note that the semantic of the inverting "no" prefix differs from
	--types: While --types=nonfs,ufs means neither nfs nor ufs,
	--test-opts=nofoo,bar means not foo, but bar.

	* utils/match-options.h: New file.
	* utils/match-options.c: Likewise.

2013-08-28  Justus Winter  <4winter@informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

	mount: add -n and --no-mtab arguments
	Add -n and --no-mtab arguments. As we do not write an mtab file, this

	pfinet: Fix call to kfree_s
	kfree_s expects a pointer and a size argument. Currently the

	intented.

	For reference, this code was present in Linux up to version 2.3.14 and

2013-07-07  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

	Fix directory rename in firmlinked directory
	checkpath browses directories up to look against renaming a directory into
	itself. It used to assume being able to stop at the root of the filesystem.  But
	some per-opens have a shadow_root, where recursion has to stop too.

	This means checkpath does not check up to the root any more. This is fine, since
	we already prevent cross-shadow-root renames very early in dir-rename.c, we
	do not need to check outside of this shadow root.

	* libdiskfs/dir-renamed.c (checkpath): Also stop at the per-open shadow_root.

	swapon is verbose by default and has a --quiet argument to make it
	quiet, so a --verbose argument on it's own does nothing at all.

	* sutils/swapon.c (main): Handle -v argument.

	sutils: fix file_name_lookup_carefully
	file_name_lookup_carefully is like file_name_lookup but tries hard to
	avoid starting any passive translators while doing the lookup. The
	callback contains code to get a new handle to the root if it
	encounters a translator, but this code was not being executed if the
	node had no record of an passive translator, just an active one.

	Fix the callback by dropping the test for a passive translator. AIUI
	the current check for a passive translator makes no sense, as the code
	is supposed to fail on encountering a passive translator.

	This fixes lookups inside translators that have no passive
	translator. For example if /run is a tmpfs started only as active
	translator, touch /run/lock && mount tmpfs -t tmpfs /run/lock -o
	size=5M would fail.

	* sutils/clookup.c (lookup): Drop the test for an passive translator.

	Add io_select_timeout to the io interface
	This change fixes a problem that can occur with non-blocking (and also
	blocking for very short times) select/poll calls. The problem occurs because
	the timeout is implemented at the client side. For a non-blocking call, this
	means that (depending on the code path taken in the C library) the client
	could get a timeout without a full RPC round-trip to the server. Moving the
	implementation of the timeout to the servers guarantees a full round-trip,
	and correct results for non-blocking calls.

	added pthread_hurd_cond_timedwait_np function in libpthread.

	Make io_select return errors
	instead of returning 0 and make clients have to actually read the error.
	This makes implementing "poll" much easier.

	Based on Svante Signell's patch.

	pipe_wait_writable.
	* trans/fifo.c (trivfs_S_io_select): Return error returned by
	pipe_wait_readable or pipe_wait_writable. Return EBADF on bogus access mode.

	Revert "libdiskfs: handle _PC_2_SYMLINKS in pathconf"
	It turned out it is the wrong approach.

	This reverts commit b6768b326c2e80f5c2326ab46459644d417c6e98.

2012-09-30  Pino Toscano  <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	tmpfs: add --size
	Add the possibility to specify the size with the --size parameter;
	this makes tmpfs more usable in fstab or Linuxish mount invocations,
	since the size in such cases is a mount -o option, which gets translated
	to a --foo translator argument.
	The old way (specifying the size as the first argument) is left there;
	although, if --size is passed then the first argument must be "tmpfs",
	as it is what is passed by fstab/mount.

	* tmpfs/tmpfs.c (OPT_SIZE): New macro.
	(options): Add the "size" option.
	(parse_opt): Use -1 to indicate when SIZE is not yet set.
	<OPT_SIZE>: Handle case.
	<ARGP_KEY_NO_ARGS>: Error out only when SIZE is not set.
	<ARGP_KEY_ARGS>: Error out when SIZE is set and the argument is not "tmpfs".

2012-09-30  Pino Toscano  <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	tmpfs: extract size string parsing in an own function
	* tmpfs/tmpfs.c (parse_opt_size): New function, broken out of ...
	(parse_opt): ... here.  Call it.

2012-09-30  Pino Toscano  <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	libdiskfs: handle _PC_2_SYMLINKS in pathconf
	Advertize the possibility to handle symlinks depending on
	DISKFS_SHORTCUT_SYMLINK.

	* libdiskfs/io-pathconf.c (diskfs_S_io_pathconf): Handle
	_PC_2_SYMLINKS too.

2012-09-23  Samuel Thibault  <samuel.thibault@ens-lyon.org>

2012-09-23  Jeremie Koenig  <jk@jk.fr.eu.org>

	Add options -k and -K to MAKEDEV.sh
	to chose not to overwrite existing entries.

	* MAKEDEV.sh: Handle -k by passing it to settrans. Handle -K by checking for

	Sync pager before clearing MAY_CACHE flag
	Clearing MAY_CACHE flag on a pager initiates a memory object
	termination if this one is not referenced anymore. If the object has a
	significant number of dirty pages (i.e. a file recently created was
	unlinked before diskfs periodical sync) this operation generates a lot
	of stress on the translator. This is one of the most common sources
	for thread storms.

	dirty pages in the object before its termination.

	MAY_CACHE flag.

	Fix return value on `getname' errors.
	This fixes the errno return value for getpeername() calls on not connected
	sockets: the return value of the `getname' call comes from the Linux code, so it
	is a negative value, in case of error.

	* pfinet/misc.c (make_sockaddr_port): Turn negative error values returned by
	`getname' calls into positive values before returning it.

	Revert "Fix tmpfs assertion"
	As discussed up to
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00021.html
	this reverts commit 97c5690abeaa88767acf2ffbb55552e8278052c8 and removes the
	corresponding assertion. This is related to commit
	2f7f90ce15cce79ef83a8d273e3a27b5b527c7d7
	which changes how much st_size is increased.

	* tmpfs/tmpfs.h (tmpfs_dirent): Remove `padding' field.
	* tmpfs/dir.c (diskfs_get_directs): Remove assertion on the position of the
	`name' field of struct tmpfs_dirent compared to the position of the `d_name'

	Keep a reference on objects to preserve their content.
	Modify tmpfs to keep a reference (by mapping it into its

	* tmpfs/tmpfs.h (struct disknode): Add `memref' field.
	* tmpfs/node.c (diskfs_get_filemap): vm_map() the first page of the
	newly-allocated object, store in `memref' field.

2010-08-26  Jeremie Koenig  <jk@jk.fr.eu.org>

	libps (fetch_procinfo): Fix non-set flag PSTAT_TASK_EVENTS
	The fetch_procinfo function failed to set the PSTAT_TASK_EVENTS when
	those has been retreived. It should be noted that GNU Mach does not
	support the TASK_EVENTS_INFO flavor, so this is of minor importance.

	The new code also checks that all the requested proc server flags
	related to a given proc_stat flags have been returned before setting the
	proc_stat flag in question.

	* libps/procstat.c (fetch_procinfo): Add map array containing `ps_flags_t' and
	`procinfo' flags.  Use it in a loop to check for flags in `need' and `have' and
	set them in `pi_flags'.  Likewise to check for flags in `pi_flags' and set them
	in `have'.

2010-08-26  Jeremie Koenig  <jk@jk.fr.eu.org>

	libps (_proc_stat_free): Fix memory leak
	The thread_waits field was never freed; this change adds the code to do
	so if the corresponding flag is set.

	Users are also warned of the consequences, namely, that they should not
	free process proc_stats before all their associated thread ones are
	gone, since the latter may reference the former's thread_waits field.
	However, with the normal interface (ie.  ps_context_free), all
	proc_stats are freed at once, so this is not an issue.

	* libps/procstat.c (_proc_stat_free): Free ps->thread_waits if
	PSTAT_THREAD_WAITS flag is set.
	* libps/ps.h (_proc_stat_free): Document that thread proc_stats must be
	freed before process proc_stat can be.

2010-08-26  Jeremie Koenig  <jk@jk.fr.eu.org>

	libps: Fix deadly typo
	PSTAT_PROCINFO is a set of flags, some of which can be obtained in
	alternative ways. In this case, _proc_stat_free will try to deallocate
	an uninitialised field. PSTAT_PROC_INFO is the flag we want.

	* libps/procstat.c (_proc_stat_free): Use PSTAT_PROC_INFO instead of
	PSTAT_PROCINFO.

2010-08-18  Jeremie Koenig  <jk@jk.fr.eu.org>

	Fix the build system to handle part stores
	Part stores are used for debian-installer, and they're considered more
	elegant than kernel partition devices. This patch makes sure they're
	included in the build unless the user disables them explicitely.

	* Makeconf: add $(PARTED_LIBS) to static binaries which use libstore_part.a.
	* configure.in: look for libparted again (see also 7c7a04eb).
	* libstore/Makefile (store-types): include the 'part' store type when
	  appropriate, remove the previous attempt.

	* console-client/Makefile (PC_KBD_SO_SRCS): Remove `kdioctlServer.c'.
	  (LCLHDRS): Remove `vga.h', add `vga-support.h' and `trans.h'.
	  (OBJS): Add `kdioctlServer.o'.

	This reverts commit 1bb5a381a2e2f345beb1ca8d019b6174b13bb125.

	storeio can actually pass the device port to other processes, through

	[$(doinst)==many] ($(targets): %:): Depend on the .o file of the
 	same name, and on all the hurd library files, and on all
 	appropriate other libraries.  Use $^ instead of $+ as we now get
 	all the libraries from the various HURDLIBS instead of from the
 	dependencies list, and this allows us to put %.o in our
 	dependencies without worrying about duplicating what the user has
 	done.  Don't explicitly link with $(libc).

	* Makeconf [$(makemode)==library]: Use $(installhdrsubdir) to
 	determine where headers in $(installhdrs) should be installed,
